# Establish pipeline configuration context if needed
#
# When the tank command executes, or when the python API is imported
# via the API proxy that is available with every non-localized pipeline config,
# an environment variable TANK_CURRENT_PC, is set, pointing at the configuration
# associated with the currently running config. This is to ensure that the right
# version of the code is associated with the currently running project
# configuration.
#
# However, in the case when a cloned configuration has been localized,
# the API proxy has been replaced by the actual core API code.
# In this case, we will set the TANK_CURRENT_PC explicitly.
#
# The logic below is fundamentally to avoid the issue that when a cloned localized
# configuration has its python sgtk/tank module imported directly, it will associate
# itself with the primary config rather than with the config where the code is located.
